@SessionAttributes is used to store model attributes in the HTTP Servlet session between requests. It is a type-level annotation that declares the session attributes used by a specific controller. This typically lists the names of model attributes or types of model attributes that should be transparently stored in the session for subsequent requests to access.


JSTL(JSP Standard Tag Library) is a collection of custom tags that provide common functionalities like flow control, database operations, etc. JSTL tags can be embedded in Java Server Pages just like other HTML tags. It is convenient for front-end developers to work with HTML-like tags for including logic in webpages rather than writing Java code in scripts

In Java, JSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology which is used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic web content. JSP consists of both HTML tags and JSP tags. In this, JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology i.e. a web-based technology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by the JSP container before processing the clientâ€™s request. JSP has various features like JSP Expressions, JSP tags, JSP Expression Language, etc.
